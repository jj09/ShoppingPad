![Shopping Pad](ShoppingPad.png)

Shopping Pad is a smart shopping list that allows you not only to create a shopping list, but it also remembers items that you have purchased in the past. This helps to create shopping list for your next grocery store trip, by suggesting items, starting from these that you purchase the most.
